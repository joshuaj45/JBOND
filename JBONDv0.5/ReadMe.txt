*Full transition metal support! You can select a transition metal and specify its charge and then bond it with any anion, and past that it works like any other ionic bond
*Started a framework for covalent bonding-- I've been doing additional research to make sure I do it right
*Mac UI optimization has been put on the back burner for now; I'm trying to get the program in full working condition first, also school is taking up a lot of my time. I'm still working on this though!
*Coming soon---- Covalent bonding, polyatomics, additional information in element tooltips (atomic weight, electron configurations)
I want to make it so that any information that you could ever need about an element is available and easy to access. I know that there's nobody using this yet, but if someone is reading this, please give me suggestions!
