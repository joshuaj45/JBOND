*Compound names are finally here! Bond any valid ionic pair of elements to see the compound name
*Added labels on the left side of the periodic table for the periods
*Added color labels to more easily distinguish the different classifications of elements
*Added a few names for groups in the tooltip text (groups 12-14 **not IUPAC approved**)
*Coming soon---- Covalent bonding (not sure how it is going to work, but I will put my full effort into this), polyatomics, atomic weights in element tooltips, electron orbitals in element tooltips
